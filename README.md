## Attrition Prediction Project

## Overview

The Attrition Prediction project aims to analyze and predict employee attrition in an organization. 
The project utilizes data from various sources, including a SQL database, Power BI visualizations, and machine learning models implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.


## Key Components

- **Jupyter Notebook:**
  - Contains the machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
  - Investigates various algorithms for predicting employee attrition.
  - Provides insights into the feature importance and model performance.

- **Power BI Visualization:**
  - Utilizes data from the SQL database to create interactive visualizations.
  - Presents key metrics related to employee attrition.
  - Enhances data exploration and understanding.

- **SQL Database:**
  - Stores and manages employee-related data.
  - Serves as a source for the Power BI visualizations and Jupyter Notebook analysis.

- **Dataset:**
  - The `Final Dataset Attrition.csv` file in the `data` folder contains the pre-processed data used in the analysis.
